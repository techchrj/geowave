In addition to the raw data to ingest, the ingest process requires an adapter to translate the native data into a format
that can be persisted into the data store. Also, the ingest process requires an Index which is a definition of all the
configured parameters that defines how data translates to row IDs (how it is indexed) and what common fields need to
be maintained within the table to be used by fine-grained and secondary filters.

The logic within the ingest process immediately ensures that the index and data adapter are persisted within the Index
Store and the Adapter Store to support self-described data discovery, although in memory implementations of both of these
stores are provided for cases when connections to Accumulo are undesirable in the ingest process (such as if ingesting
bulk data in a Map-Reduce job). Then the flow determines the set of row IDs that the data will need to be inserted in -
duplication is essential under certain circumstances and therefore data may be inserted in multiple locations
(for example, polygons that cross the dateline, or date ranges that cross binning boundaries such as
December 31-January 1 when binning by year). De-duplication is always performed as a client filter when querying the
data. This will be combined with the actual data in a persistable format (after a translation has been performed by the
adapter) to create a set of mutations.

There is a Writer interface that the data store's AccumuloOperations will instantiate which specifies how the mutations
will actually be written. The default implementation will wrap an Accumulo BatchWriter with this interface, but in some
cases it could make sense to provide a custom implementation of the writer - if performing a bulk ingest within the
mapper or reducer of a job, it would be appropriate to define a writer to add the mutations to the context of the bulk
ingest rather than writing live to Accumulo.
