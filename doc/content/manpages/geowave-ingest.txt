-hdfsingest::
Copy supported files from local file system to HDFS and ingest from HDFS

-hdfsstage::

Options are specific to operation choice. Use <operation> -h for help.

The ingest plugin supports two types of ingest, Local and HDFS. Which you use probably depends on the type and amount of
data you need to load. The framework handles abstracting across the two methods, so you only need to write the code once.

The hdfsingest option is actually just the hdfsstage and poststage methods chained together. Using them separately is
useful if you have a use case to ingest the same data multiple times from hdfs, or if you have a process that has already
loaded the data into hdfs.

Each plugin in the ingest framework is required to identify the type of files it can ingest. The coarse filter is based
on file extension, and then a secondary filter can be created based on reading the contents of the file.

The intent is to allow the user to point to a directory of files and for the framework to discover and ingest all
possible types. The user can explicitly select only certain plugins if they need to narrow this down.
