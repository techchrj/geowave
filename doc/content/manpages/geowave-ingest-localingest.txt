NAME
//:----

geowave-ingest-localingest - Load content from local file system

SYNOPSIS
//:--------

*geowave-ingest -localingest* <options>

DESCRIPTION
//:-----------

The geowave-ingest -localingest(1) operator will run the ingest code (parse to features, load features to accumulo)
against local file system content.

OPTIONS
//:-------

-b, --base <arg>::
Base input file or directory to crawl with one of the supported ingest types

-c, --clear::
Clear ALL data stored with the same prefix as this namespace (optional; default is to append data to the namespace if it exists)

-dim, --dimensionality <arg>::
The dimensionality type for the index, either 'spatial' or 'spatial-temporal' (optional; default is 'spatial')

-h, --help::
Display help

-i, --instance-id <arg>::
The Accumulo instance ID

-l, --list::
List the available ingest types

-n, --namespace <arg>::
The table namespace (optional; default is no namespace)

-p, --password <arg>::
The password for the user

-t, --types <arg>::
Explicitly set the ingest type by name (or multiple comma-delimited types), if not set all available ingest types will be used

-u, --user <arg>::
A valid Accumulo user ID

-v, --visibility <arg>::
The visibility of the data ingested (optional; default is 'public')

-x, --extension <arg>::
Individual or comma-delimited set of file extensions to accept (optional)

-z, --zookeepers <arg>::
A comma-separated list of zookeeper servers that an Accumulo instance is using

ADDITIONAL
//:----------

The index type uses one of the two predefined index implementations. You can perform temporal lookup/filtering with
either, but the spatial-temporal includes indexing in the primary index - so will be more performant if spatial extents
are commonly used when querying data.

Visibility is passed to Accumulo as a string, so you should put whatever you want in here.

The namespace option is the GeoWave namespace; this will be the prefix of the GeoWave tables in Accumulo. There are a
few rules for this that derive from geotools/geoserver as well as Accumulo. To keep it simple if you only use alphabet
characters and "_" (underscore) you will be fine.

The extensions argument allows you to override the plugin types, narrowing the scope of what is passed to the plugins

The types argument allows you to explicitly only use certain plugins.

Finally, the base directory is the root directory that will be scanned on the local system for files to ingest. The
process will scan all subdirectories under the provided directory.

EXAMPLES
//:--------

List all of the currently registered as ingest type plugins:

*geowave-ingest -localingest --list*::

geotools-vector:
     all file-based vector datastores supported within geotools

tdrive:
     files from Microsoft Research T-Drive trajectory data set

geolife:
     files from Microsoft Research GeoLife trajectory data set

gpx:
     xml files adhering to the schema of gps exchange format

geotools-raster:
     all file-based raster formats supported within geotools

Load some load data::
geowave-ingest -localingest -b ./ingest -i instance -n adminborders -p pass -t geotools-vector -u user -z zoo-1:2181
