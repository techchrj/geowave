[[ingest-framework]]
=== Framework

A plugin framework (using SPI based injection) is provided, and several methods are supported out of the box.
The plugin framework is created in geowave-ingest, and the supported types are in geowave-types.

First we will show how to build and use the built in types, and after that describe how to create a new plugin.

==== Building ingest framework

This assumes you have already built the main project, if not first do that

[NOTE]
You should either edit the geowave/pom.xml file for the correct Accumulo, Hadoop, GeoTools, and GeoServer versions,
or supply command line parameters to override them.

[source, bash]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:ngageoint/geowave.git
$ cd geowave
$ mvn clean install
----

now we can build the ingest framework with included types

[source, bash]
----
$ cd geowave-types
$ mvn package -Pingest-singlejar
----

The ingest file is now packaged in target. When packaged for installation there will be a wrapper script named geowave-ingest
that will be installed in $PATH. In a development environment were this script has not been installed you can use the
artifact directly with the command ```java -jar geowave-types-VERSION-ingest-tool.jar <operation> <options>```

==== Ingesting all the things

We can ingest any data type that has been listed as an ingest plugin. Let's start out with the GeoTools datastore; this
wraps a bunch of GeoTools supported formats. We will use the shapefile capability for our example here.

==== Something recognizable

The naturalearthdata side has a few shapefile we can use use. On the page
http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-cultural-vectors/[50m Cultural Vectors]

Let's download the Admin 0 - Countries shapefile:
http://naciscdn.org/naturalearth/50m/cultural/ne_50m_admin_0_countries.zip[ne_50m_admin_0_countries.zip]

[source, bash]
----
$ mkdir ingest
$ mv ne_50m_admin_0_countries.zip ingest/
$ cd ingest
$ unzip ne_50m_admin_0_countries.zip
$ rm ne_50m_admin_0_countries.zip
$ cd ..
$ geowave-ingest -localingest \
      -b ./ingest \
      -i ACCUMULO_INSTANCE_NAME \
      -n geowave.50m_admin_0_countries \ <1>
      -t geotools-vector \ <2>
      -u USERNAME \
      -p PASSWORD \
      -z ZOOKEEPER_HOST_NAME:2181

<1> We preface the table name with the Accumulo namespace we configured earlier in the Accumulo configuration section followed by a dot (NAMESPACE.TABLE_NAME)
<2> Ensure you match the correct GeoWave ingest plugin type for the data you are ingesting

After running the ingest command you should see the various index tables in Accumulo
